### Undergraduate Work

I attended the University of Alabama from 2011 to 2015, graduating with a B.S.
in Physics and Mathematics with a minor in German. At Alabama, I spent time
working for [Dr. Dawn Williams](https://physics.ua.edu/profiles/dawn-r-williams/)
and [Dr. Conor Henderson](http://chenderson.people.ua.edu).

Dr. Williams works on the [IceCube neutrino experiment](https://icecube.wisc.edu),
which studies astrophysical neutrinos in the TeV to PeV energy range from active
galactic nuclei and gamma ray bursts.  My work involved studying calibration data
and writing tests for the monitoring system used in the detector.

Dr. Henderson works on the
[Compact Muon Solenoid](https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms)
(CMS) experiment, which studies a wide range of high energy physics topics,
including probing the Standard Model, searching for extra dimensions, and looking
for dark matter particle candidates. My work in the Henderson group focused on
studying how different values used in a model would affect the kinematics of the
decay products observed by the detector.

### Graduate Work

I began my graduate research under
[Kendall Mahn](https://pa.msu.edu/profile/mahn/) at Michigan State University
in the summer of 2015. My initial work was spent investigating possible model
updates for a neutrino interaction simulator.

In the spring of 2016, I joined the
[T2K experiment](https://t2k-experiment.org), a neutrino oscillation experiment
based in Tokai, Japan. That summer, I was awarded the Japan Society for the
Promotion of Science (JSPS)
[Summer Program](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-summer/) fellowship to study
in Kashiwa, Japan for ten weeks. I spent my time in Japan studying the viability
of a change to one of the third-party software programs used by T2K's neutrino
interaction simulator.

My dissertation research involved incorporating additional samples from the T2K
near detector and testing model effects on the results of theneutrino oscillation
analysis.

### Current Work

After receiving my Ph.D. in 2019, I was hired into the
[Shen lab](https://shenlab.vai.org) as a Bioinformatics Research Scientist. My
work now involves maintaining [BISCUIT](https://huishenlab.github.io/biscuit/),
a command line tool to align and study DNA methylation using bisulfite (or
bisulfite-like) sequencing data, as well as writing and maintaining other analysis
tools used by myself and members of the lab.
